Create telegram bot
To send a message to Telegram group or channel, you should first create your own bot. Just open Telegram, find @BotFather and type /start. Then follow instructions to create bot and get token to access the HTTP API.

3.Create Channel
Create a new Channel in Telegram and add your bot as a member. So your bot could send messages to the Channel.

In order to get Channel Id, first, post any message to the Channel ( like "test" ). Then use this link template to get Channel Id:

https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates

4. edit your telegram-send.sh with you channel id

```sh
nano telegram-send.sh
```

Change GROUP_ID and BOT_TOKEN with your own credentials and exit with ctrl+xy and enter. 

## Usage
bash ./stealwatcher.sh DOMAIN

ex:

```sh
bash ./stealwatcher.sh w44
```

By default, it takes the current year of the machine. But you can specifiy a year as a second argument.

```sh
bash ./stealwatcher.sh google 1997
